## Data Visualization

The objectives of the course were to:

Design and program data visualizations using either R or Python to illustrate data-based categorical, hierarchical, relational, temporal and spatial insights. These visualizations were presented on a summary slide, along with important insights and recommendations. Best practices for data display, color, typography, composition and narrative were emphasized. 

There were five individual assignments in which a data type (categorial, hierarchical, relational, temporal and spatial) was examined and visualized. The visualization was summarized on one slide. 

The five data types and their respective visualizations are:
Temporal – Video Game Industry
Categorical – One Star Michelin Restaurants
Hierarchical – SpaceX Missions
Relational – The Nobel Prize
Spatial – Cook County ME Opioid Related Deaths

The final project was a team effort to create a browser-based presentation of at least twelve data visualizations. The topic selected by my group was the opioid epidemic. I created slides based on Naloxone Administration by First Responders and Urban Opioid Related Deaths in the Chicago Area. For the Naloxone data, I utilized a database available for public use through the National EMS Information System (NEMSIS). For the opioid related deaths in the Chicago area, I utilized case archive data made available through the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office.

I used Python and R programming languages throughout the course.
