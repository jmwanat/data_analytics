## Data Visualization

The objectives of the course were to:

Design and program data visualizations using either R or Python to illustrate data-based categorical, hierarchical, relational, temporal and spatial insights. These visualizations 
were presented on a summary slide, along with important insights and recommendations. Best practices for data display, color, typography, composition and narrative were emphasized.

### Individual Assignments
There were five individual assignments in which a data type (categorial, hierarchical, relational, temporal and spatial) was examined and visualized. The visualization was 
summarized on one slide. 

The five data types and their respective visualizations are:
1. Temporal – Video Game Industry
2. Categorical – One Star Michelin Restaurants
3. Hierarchical – SpaceX Missions
4. Relational – The Nobel Prize
5. Spatial – Cook County ME Opioid Related Deaths

### Team Project
The final project was a team effort to create a browser-based presentation of at least twelve data visualizations. The topic selected by my group was the opioid epidemic. I created
slides based on Naloxone Administration by First Responders and Urban Opioid Related Deaths in the Chicago Area. For the Naloxone data, I utilized a database available for public 
use through the National EMS Information System ([NEMSIS](https://nemsis.org/)). For the opioid related deaths in the Chicago area, I utilized case archive data made available 
through the [Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Public-Safety/Medical-Examiner-Case-Archive/cjeq-bs86).

I used Python and R programming languages throughout the course.
