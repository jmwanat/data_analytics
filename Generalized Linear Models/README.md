# Generalized Linear Models

This course utilized linear regression, logistic regression and poisson regression.

## Linear Regression
The goal of this project was to predict the number of wins for a professional baseball team. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted. EDA is used to understand the types of variables in the data set. EDA uses descriptive statistics, when possible, to summarize the variables. The data is also examined for errors, outliers, and missing values. Visualization techniques such as boxplots, histograms, and scatterplots are used to visualize the data relationships and distribution.

The data was prepared for analysis in which missing values were imputed, variables with outliers were transformed in order to reduce the effect of outliers on model accuracy, and the data set was split into a 70/30 train/test split. Splitting the data allows for cross-validation after a predictive model has been developed. The train data set was used for in-sample model development, and the test data set was used for out-of-sample model assessment of predictive accuracy.

This report utilized R Markdown, in which the document text and code are prepared in the same notebook interface.
